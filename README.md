## Intuition and Purposes
The reason I built this app was inspired by a post written by current university student. There are lots of university students that are having trouble with cooking. Some students do cook, but they also want to keep a healthy body and stay fit. Generally, there are recipe websites, but not much so about nutrients information. Therefore, I decided to create this app.

## How to Use
When launch the app, you can view the instructions on the page. Even though the main purpose of the app is to provide recipes and nutrients information, you can also ask anything you want from the latest news, to weather, to calculating a simple expression, to a random conversation.

When you asked for a random or a specific recipe, the app will show you all the results on the screen. You can ask for more recipes, view details or instructions.
